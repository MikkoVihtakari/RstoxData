\description{
Read NMD XML format file. Supports only Biotic version 1.4 and 3, Echosounder version 1, and Landing version 2 formats at the moment.
Streaming XML pull parser can be used to avoid loading the whole XML into memory and it supports ZIP file reading. Please note that
the XML file inside the zip file should be using the same name as the zip file itself (e.g. test.xml inside test.zip).
}

\dontrun{
# Reading test.xml using XML DOM parser
one <- readXmlFile("./test.xml")
# Reading test.xml using XML pull parser
two <- readXmlFile("./test.xml", stream = TRUE)
# Reading test.xml inside test.zip file
three <- readXmlFile("./test.zip", stream = TRUE)
